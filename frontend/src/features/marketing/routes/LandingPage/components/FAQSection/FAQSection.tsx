    question: 'Do I need a YouTube account to use RiffTube?',
    answer:
      'Nope! Any public YouTube link works. Paste it in and start riffing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I keep my riffs private?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Projects can be public, unlisted, or private—your call.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I invite friends to riff with me?',
    answer:
      'Collaborative riffing is on our roadmap. For now each riff is solo, but you can share a link to your finished riff.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to install anything?',
    answer: 'No installs. RiffTube lives entirely in your browser.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if the video is removed from YouTube?',
    answer:
      "Your riff stays safe, but playback won't work. Just attach the riff to a different video anytime.",
  },
