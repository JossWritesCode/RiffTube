In the glorious tradition of Mystery Science Theater 3000, The Film Crew, RiffTrax, Cinematic Titanic, MST3k again, and others...

Now presenting: **you**.

**RiffTube** lets you add your own riffs to any video on YouTube. Watch, comment, create ‚Äî your voice, your style, your movie night.

---

## Getting Started

This project uses a Vite + React frontend and a Ruby on Rails API backend. They are booted separately but coordinated during development.

---

### üíª IDE Setup

We recommend using **Visual Studio Code** for local development.

1. **Open the project folder in VS Code**
2. **When prompted, install the recommended extensions:**
   - Prettier (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)
   - ESLint (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)
   - RuboCop (`rubocop.vscode-rubocop`)
3. **On save, your code will auto‚Äëformat** for:
   - JavaScript & TypeScript (via Prettier + ESLint)
   - Ruby (via RuboCop)

---

### üîß Linting & Formatting

The `package.json` includes scripts for checking and formatting code in both the frontend and backend.

To lint everything:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To format everything automatically:

```bash
npm run format
```

You can also target each side individually:

```bash
# Frontend only
npm run lint:frontend
npm run format:frontend

# Backend only
npm run lint:backend
npm run format:backend
```

To check if your frontend code is formatted correctly (without writing changes):

```bash
npm run check-format
```

> Prettier is configured to:
>
> - Automatically sort **import statements**
> - Automatically sort **Tailwind CSS classes**
> - Use plugins: `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports` and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

> Tailwind class merging is handled by [`tailwind-merge`](https://github.com/dcastil/twmerge), so dynamic class overrides stay clean and conflict-free.

> Prettier configuration can be found in `frontend/prettier.config.js` or within `frontend/package.json`.

---

### üìò Storybook (Component Previews)

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to build and document components in isolation.

To start Storybook locally:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006)

Use this during development to preview components and check for visual or logic regressions.

---

### 1. Install dependencies

We‚Äôve added a convenient script that installs both frontend and backend dependencies in one go:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

This runs `npm install` in `frontend/` and `bundle install` in `backend/`.

---

### 2. Set up environment variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the project root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Fill in real credentials in `.env` for your local database connection and CORS settings:

```bash
DATABASE_USERNAME=your_postgres_username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
```

> **Important:** `.env` must be located at the project root (`/RiffTube/.env`), **not inside `/backend` or `/frontend`**.

---

### 3. Set up the database

```bash
cd backend
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

This will:

- Create the `rifftube_development` and `rifftube_test` databases
- Enable the `uuid-ossp` extension for UUID primary keys

---

### 4. Start the app

From the project root, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will concurrently start:

- Rails API ‚Üí http://localhost:3000
- Vite frontend ‚Üí http://localhost:5173

---

## üßπ Local Development Setup Checklist

- [ ] `.env` exists at project root and contains correct database and CORS variables
- [ ] `npm run install:all` completed without errors
- [ ] `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate` completed without errors
- [ ] Rails server (`rails server`) starts successfully
- [ ] Vite server (`npm run dev`) starts successfully
- [ ] Access Rails API at `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Access React frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Storybook accessible at `http://localhost:6006`

## üìù Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for a clear history and automated workflows.

**Commit messages should:**

- Use the imperative, present tense (e.g., `add x to y`, not `added x to y`)
- Begin with a type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`

**Pull request conventions:**

- **Title:** Must match your commit message
- **Body:** Include `resolves #<issue-number>` to automatically close the related issue

**Example:**

**PR Title:**
`feat: support time-traveling riffs from future disappointed users`

**PR Body:**

```text
resolves #303

- allows pre-emptive commentary before scenes even happen
- breaks causality but improves engagement metrics
```

---

## Automated Releases

This project uses [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) to automate changelog generation and versioning.

Releases are triggered by Conventional Commits on the `main` branch.

- Version numbers are automatically incremented
- Changelog entries are generated
- GitHub releases are published
